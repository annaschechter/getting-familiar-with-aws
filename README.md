Getting familiar with AWS
=========================
When researching technologies for our final project StackOverTube I wrote this console programm which allows users:
* create buckets on AWS
* list buckets on AWS
* upload files to a bucket
* download files from a bucket

Languages and Tools
-------------------
* Ruby

How to use
----------
Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/annaschechter/getting-familiar-with-aws.git
```
Open the file:
```
$ ruby aws.rb
``` 
Then you will see the menu print in the console.
